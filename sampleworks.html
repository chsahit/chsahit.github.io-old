			<h6><i>The Agency at the GT College of Computing</i></h6> 
                        <p> I built this my first semester of freshman year with a few other students as an introduction
                        to classical Artificial Intelligence as well as more modern machine learning. The problem this project
                        aims to solve is that typically the "learning rate" of a neural network has to be tuned by hand. As
                        is the case with hand tuned parameters, the learning rate takes time to tune and it is painful to do
                        it methodically. Our solution was to use a genetic algorithm to optimize the neural network. The
                        deign and implementation of this genetic algorithm was my contribution to this project. As a opposed to
                        a randomly selected learning rate, the genetic algorithm was able to calculate one that lead to a 20%
                        gain in accuracy. Click the link for the github!</p>

                                FIRST Stronghold: Platypus</a></h1>
			<h6><i>Mount Olive Robotics Team</i></h6> 
                        <p> This was my High School FIRST Robotics team's creation after 6 weeks to design, build, and program. Our challenge involved 
                        being able to cross uneven terrain and launch foam balls into the tower. As lead developer I wrote the motion profiling and PID controllers
                        that enabled our robot to navigate autonomously into the tower. I also used a combination of feedback and feedforward control to spin the flywheel
                        up to our shooting RPM. Keeping the back intake level was particularly challenging as the robot had to deal with a constantly changing setpoint
                        given by the drivers as well as all the jostling from contact with other robots. As a result, I had to learn how to methodically tune PID controllers 
                        that I also wrote. Later in the season the robot was able to use its camera because of the work teammates and I did with OpenCV do get the robot
                        to identify the target. Our robot seeded first and then lead the winning team at the Springside-Chestnut Hill district competition. </p>
