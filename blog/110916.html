                    <p style="padding-left:10px; padding-right:10px;">So here we are again, This is my third iteration on a personal website, 
                    and also my third time trying to start a blog. I recently read Steve Yegge's excellent 
                    <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/you-should-write-blogs">article</a> 
                    (which I would highly reccomend) on why it's a good idea to blog, and I need a new hobby.
                    There are a few things I want to do differently this time, so that I don't stop writing again. I want my blogging to 
                    employ fewer parenthetical asides, as I have a problem with that when I write. The occasional one is fine, 
                    but sometimes asides have a way of taking away from the original point you wanted to make. I'm planning to release a
                    post three times a week, a la XKCD. I also don't want to find myself obsessing more about the software behind the website
                    as opposed to the content I'm publishing. And of course, I don't want to limit myself to just dry written paragraphs about 
                    broad and arbitrary ideas. I plan to allocate this corner of my website to host updates on my life, videos of me making music,
                    and of course, dry paragraphs written about arbitrary and broad concepts. And with that, we begin.</p>
                    <p style="padding-left:10px; padding-right:10px"> I want to spend today talking about discipline and motivation. 
                    I said that I would make a post three times a week, and that's pretty ambitious for me. The next part of this post 
                    will be kind of a letter to myself so that I remember why I'm doing this. </p>
                    <p>Dear Sahit</p>
                    <p style="padding-left:10px; padding-right:10px">Your sense of motivation has failed you before, and it will fail you again. 
                    Motivation is something that comes and goes and it's not something you can rely on. Sometimes your purpose isn't clear, 
                    you forget why you're studying or even going to college at all. But there are facts you need to remember. </p>
                    <p>You're here to change the world. There are so many ways to improve our environment but you can't leverage them
                    without education. <p>
                    <p>Don't incentivize youself with that rush of accomplishment that comes with finishing a task. Those are far and few
                    between. Take pleasure in what you're doing, find something to like about it. </p>
                    <p>Keep smiling</p>
                    <p>Stay active. It doesn't matter what you are doing so long as it's productive. Social media can be incredibly useful, 
                    but it's also a timesink. Taking a break can be productive, it's important to walk away from the desk. But don't let 
                    that break be scrolling through old snapchat stories, invest yourself in a hobby instead. Reading, playing the piano, 
                    and pet projects are all fine ways to take a break</p>
                    <p style="padding-left:10px;padding-right:10px"> Ultimately, discipline is your friend. You're going to have to do things
                    you don't enjoy, that's part of life. Waking up early for class or reading a boring textbook are inevitable. But with discipline, 
                    you can power through those things and move to what you love. Don't beat yourself up too much when you fail, simply learn from it. 
                    Obviously all of this advice is old news, but it helps to look at it again and have it in one place. Your brain is good at coming
                    up with excuses to slack off, force it to do something else.
                    </p>
                    <p> Sincerely </p>
                    <p> Yourself </p>
