                    <p style="padding-left:10px; padding-right:10px;text-align:center">
                    I spent yesterday at the Rockwell Automation fair, representing Robojackets, and it was quite an experience. 
                    Perhaps the highlight of the day, was meeting Blake Moret, the CEO of Rockwell Automation. He was rather personable
                    and had a lot of advice to give. Moret graduated with a degree in Mechanical Engineering from GT, took on a sales
                    job for a while, and rose through the corporate ladder to now lead a billion dollar industrial automation company.</p>
                    <p style="padding-left:10px;padding-right:10px;text-align:center">
                    I was struck by this difference in field of study vs occupation, so my first question for Moret was if anything he learned
                    as an ME had use in his current role. Moret told me that although the specifics of his courses are not needed in day-to-day
                    work, his minor in technical communications was a large asset in maneuvering through the corporate world. He then dropped
                    one of the many nuggets of wisdom I would go on to hear. <u>Lifelong learning is huge</u>. Moret still tries to expose
                    himself to new ideas and was aiming for an MBA. In my own opinion, learning is central to being an effective leader. It
                    exposes you to ways of thinking that may not have come naturally.</p>
                    <p style="padding-left:10px;padding-right:10px;text-align:center">
                    Another idea Moret elaborated on was the dynamics behind leading a team. His thought process could be best summed up with
                    the quote hung up outside my physics teacher's door:</p>
                    <p style="padding-left:10px:padding-right:10px;text-align:center"><i>If you want to build a ship, don't drum up the men to gather wood, 
                        divide the work and give orders. Instead, teach them to yearn for the vast and endless sea. - A. Saint-Exupery</i></p>
                    <p style="padding-left:10px;padding-right:10px;text-align:center">
                    In other words, you'll get more done when your teammates are working <i>with</i> you, as opposed to for you. 
                    I'm not sure how much experience leading a highschool club counts, but I can empathize. Instead, Psychology might be a better teacher. 
                    We are focusing on emotion this week in class, and currently that means studying emotions. Studies find that people do what 
                    they can to reduce "cognitive attitude". Meaning that if they are in an environment of people working towards a goal, their
                    attitudes will change, and with it - their behavior. </p>
                    <p style="padding-left:10px;padding-right:10px;text-align:center">
                    Being a leader is hard. But I suppose practice makes perfect</p>
