                    The Hamilton Post!</h1>
                    <p>I just finished watching the documentary "Hamilton's America",
                    and man, what a ride. I also spent a chunk of today at 
                    Ronald Reagan's Presidential library, so today's a day I'm 
                    proud to be an American. I think the takeaway from the two
                    experiences was that leaders who are so often hyped up are
                    at the end of the day, human beings. They are flawed like the
                    rest of us but they were just trying to do what's right. 
                    I think everyone whishes that someone with Reagan's demeanor
                    represented GOP in our general election. The museum was
                    really well put together for the most part and it was 
                    interesting seeing how Reagan grew from a presidential boy
                    to a presidential man.</p>
                    <p>Back to Hamilton. I am O B S S E S S E D. The musical itself,
                    the mixtape,, and the documentary were all incredibly well put
                    together and captivating. The musical transitions in the musical
                    made listening to the whole play consecutively absolutely worth.
                    I also liked that we saw the flaws of the protagonist, Alexander
                    Hamilton, and the the virtues of the antagonist, Aaron Burr. 
                    I was able to relate to aspects of both characters. Seeing
                    Ben Folds and Sia both appear on the mixtape was awesome and 
                    I was really excited to hear more from Lin Manuel Miranda as well. 
                    If there's one thing the Hamilton line has demonstrated, 
                    it's that LMM is a genius. But it goes to show how important 
                    it is to read books and to draw inspiration from the things 
                    in your life around you. I walked away from listening to the 
                    musical with an appreciation of America that I couldn't get 
                    from reading a textbook. As Miranda said so well in his documentary,
                    reading about Hamilton's vigor really makes you question 
                    what you're doing in your own life. </p>
