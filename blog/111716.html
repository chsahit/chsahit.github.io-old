                    <h1 style="padding-left:10px;padding-right:10px;text-align:center"> Why Finishing a Project is so hard </h1>
                    <p> At any point in time I have a number of individual projects going on. I'm trying to do some image processing
                    on my FPGA, play with a genetic algorithm that optimizes neural networks for AI club, learn scala and implement
                    A* with it, and write a kalman filter for RoboJackets. There are also hobbies I want to pursue like tennis and piano. 
                    While I may finish the club projects I do, I always 
                    struggle to finish my personal ones. There are two things to consider with this: why do I struggle to 
                    finish personal projects and is it really a bad thing?
                    </p>     
                    <p> The answer to that first question is relatively trivial. Time is a valuable resource. It's simply more
                    practical to allocate my time towards school work and group projects where I am acountable to someone
                    other than myself. I owe it to myself to get the work assigned to me done and I owe it to teammates
                    to finish the work I commited to doing. </p>
                    <p>However, that's not the entire story. I discussed this in my first post as well, but my time 
                    management is not where it <i>could</i> be. Sure I get done what I need to get done, but there's
                    so much more to do. I think if I sacrifice another hour and a half of my day to sleep I would
                    be far more productive with my remaining ~16 hours. I should be able to test that tonight.</p>
                    <p>Now to the question of whether it's really so bad that I fail to personal projects. The answer
                    that: It depends. Usually, I set out on a project to learn something new. If I finish enough of
                    the  project to learn what I wanted to learn then that's great. For instance, I would love if
                    my implementation of A* came with a decent GUI to illustrate what it was doing. However, not having
                    such GUI really wouldn't add to my understanding of search algorithms. The exception to this, is 
                    me setting out to build a product that's meant to be used by people. In that instance, aesthetic and 
                    user interface are just as important as core functionality</p> 
                    <br/>
                    <p>Because I'm a day late with this post I'll toss in some personal updates! I can almost play Fur Elise the
                    way I used to and am getting through pulling off the grace notes in the opening of Billy Joel's Vienna. 
                    Also, "ya boy" is now part of the organizing team for <a href="http://hackgt.com">HackGT</a>! These are
                    exciting times :) </p>
