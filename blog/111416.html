                    <p style="padding-left:10px; padding-right:10px;text-align:center">
                    I finished reading Arthur C. Clarke's "Childhood's End" a week ago and it was such an awesome book
                    I thought' I'd talk about it. I'm trying to read more in college than I did in HS and I'm off to a decent start.
                    I finished Machiavelli's "The Prince" and am currently reading Bertrand Russel's "The Problems of Philosophy". But,
                    back to Clarke.</p>
                    <p style="padding-left:10px; padding-right:10px;text-align:center">
                    The novel is divided into 3 parts and a preface, each flipping through a chapter of human history, starting 
                    somewhere in the mid 20th century. Humanity is about to jump into the stars, having finished build settlements
                    capable going through space. Shortly before our maiden voyage, alien ships appear in the sky over Earth's major
                    cities. It is with this opening we leap from to the preface into the novel. We see as these aliens, referred to
                    as the Overlords, guide humanity into one worldwide nation free from war. We enter a golden period of human history,
                    a post-scarcity society where humans are free to learn as they will. In the final part of the novel, the reader sees
                    humanity undergo a transformation the Overlords are incapable of experiencing. Earth's last generation melds with 
                    the "Overmind" and the infinity of space is open to us. </p>
                    <p style="padding-left:10px; padding-right:10px;text-align:center">
                    Before I launch into being confused, let me just say that this book was wonderful. I actually couldn't put it down.
                    I missed a robotics meeting because I was lying on a bench reading this, and that says something. Clarke is rightfully
                    reknowned for his imagination and his style gives somebody looking for a distraction a universe to get lost in. 
                    The action is paced just right and Clarke is able to tell his story despite a singular protagonist. As a matter of 
                    fact, it might be the only book I read where the protagonist was the whole of human society. The book poses some 
                    interesting questions about human nature and this is where my questions start to arise</p>
                    <p style="padding-left:10px; padding-right:10px;text-align:center">
                    The Overlords purpose is to prevent humans from wiping themselves out and expediate their transition to the Overmind.
                    This plot device seems to rest on the assumption that humans are likely not going to be able to sustain 
                    themselves without alien help. This is a little harsh in my opinion, I like to think we in a species are a little
                    more responsible than that. However, current trends in politics and environmental resposibility seem to be taking Clarke's
                    side. I suppose only time will tell if we as a species are really capable of taking care of ourselves. 
                   </p>
                   <p style="padding-left:10px; padding-right:10px;text-align:center">
                   Another idea depicted in this book is that when humanity moves into a post-scarcity society art will languish and
                   we will become a species of sponges, just idly absorbing knowledging without producing. This assertion is scary
                   because it's not quite unrealistic. Art tends to center around the human condition, without any thirst or need
                   for desire that human condition will be severely stunted. Obviously, scientists are still performing research
                   and humans are still learning, but the presence of a vastly more intelligent species to take care of humans
                   reduces the need for research. It's an interesting idea that without at least some suffering good art becomes 
                   rare. Then again, I'm sitting here listening to Taylor Swift; she wouldn't have nearly as many hits without
                   undergoing romantic strife. 
                   </p>

                   The Overlords tell humans that the stars are not for man. This is not an opinion of Clarke, but it is another 
                   scarily realistic tenet. Space is vast, almost unexporably so. Our current understanding of science limits us
                   to a mere 3E8 m/s. Space travel on an interstellar level is well beyond anything the scale of anything humans
                   have tried to do before. That being said, science is provisional. I could wake up tomorrow and find out that
                   entanglement holds the key to superluminal transportation. Will I? Probably not. But it will be exciting
                   to see where science goes from here and if someday humans can roam the stars the way Columbus roamed the planet.
                   Science is cool!
