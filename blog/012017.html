                        <p>I had an interview for a summer internship earlier this week!
                        The company was called Datascan and the culture was definitely one
                        of the coolest that I had ever seen. The <s>employees</s> associates
                        were all incredibly friendly and the team had great chemistry.
                        The CFO came in and talked to all of us and I fell in love with
                        one of the things he had to say. "Don't listen to respond, listen to
                        understand". I probably liked th aphorism so much because it clearly
                        points out a part of me that I'm trying to understand. There's 
                        a difference between carying on a conversation and having a meaningful
                        discussion, and the difference comes down to how one listens. 
                        It's only through the latter that any meaningful work can
                        get done. <p>
                        <p> Also: update on the semester. It's hard. Like, decidedly
                        nontrivial. It's not that any one class is too challenging.
                        Rather, all the projects with all the homework is rather hard
                        to manage. I think I can handle it, nay, I know I can.
                        (These are very stream of consciousness writings, in case 
                        you haven't noted). Still, everything I have to do is interesting
                        and engaging, so there is worth in doing it. I'm very excited
                        for the growth this semester holds</p>
