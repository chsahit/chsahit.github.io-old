                    <h1 style="padding-left:10px;padding-right:10px;text-align:center"> On "The Problems of Philosophy" </h1>
                    <p>I finished reading reading Bertrand Russell's "The 
                    Problem's of Philosophy". For a rather slim book, it
                    took an incredibly long time to read. This makes sense.
                    While the book was short, it certainly was dense. Russell's
                    work features sentences the size of paragraphs and moves
                    quickly through abstract ideas. It wasn't exactly jumping 
                    into the deep end of the pool of philosophy nor was the book
                    shallow. The book hit a good blend of the two where the final product
                    was comprehensible to a newcomer in the field, but only after
                    some work. Essentially, each paragraph either presented a new 
                    argument or criticized a presented argument. The result being that 
                    losing focus while reading makes it impossible to understand what
                    the book is saying. Russell starts his readers off by telling the
                    story of Descartes and his arrival at "je pense, donc je suis".
                    We then look at the validity of information arriving through
                    our senses and from there begin a trek into considering the nature
                    of that information. The book ends by considering what the limits
                    of knowledge are and then an argument for why one would study
                    philosophy. This last chapter was my favorite. Russell's 
                    argument was that philosophy opens the mind to new possibilities,
                    and that the questions that are being asked are just as
                    interesting as answers that may or may not be extant. 
                    It was the hardest book I read while in college, but it 
                    may have been the most worthwhile.</p>
                    <p>Some more updates! I haven't posted in a while so here's
                    what's  happening. I was on winter break back home and got back
                    to Atlanta yesterday! Break was spent with family and friends,
                    which was relaxing. I also had a brief incursion into q-learning,
                    an AI algorithm. Classes started today. I had Data Structures,
                    Objects&Design, and Multivariable Calc today. My professor's seemed fairly
                    amicable and best of all, fair. This'll be my first time taking
                    a courseload of mostly CS classes, which is really cool. I have
                    my first philosophy class ever tomorrow and unsuprisingly, I'm 
                    pumped.
