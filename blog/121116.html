                    <p>I straight up have no clue what I'm going to write about</p>
                    <p>Yeah, not even a little!</p>
                    <p>Its finals week! I have exams in linear and psych as
                    well as a portfolio I need to write for english. Linear was 
                    Thursday and went fairly well, but in retrospect I could have
                    proved things a little better. I'm writing an SVM for pixel 
                    classification for robojackets and the math is pretty cool. 
                    It's like the least squares lines we learned how to generate 
                    in linear but now we're trying to maximize distances between
                    two classes of data points. Maybe when I get the code ported
                    to C++ I'll write about it. </p>
                    <p>I'm currently reading up on social psychology in preparation 
                    for my upcoming final. Part of me wants to think of social psych 
                    as a case study in why people are awful, but that's not really
                    fair. Turns out it's pretty easy to get people to work together...
                    in theory. Reading the chapter enforces the fact that people 
                    aren't fundamentally "bad"/racist/*ist. Typically they just 
                    lack exposure to people who aren't like them. Even if travel
                    is too expensive, the advancement of technology makes it pretty 
                    easy to join a community of people who you disagree with. 
                    Turns out all humans have something in common, even if we don't 
                    like to limit. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_polarization">
                    Group Polarization</a> is also a very real problem where people 
                    tend to radicalize, alienating them from the values that others hold.
                    It is this polarization that is likely the cause of our current
                    political client and why it's important to make friends with
                    people who disagree with you. There are ways to prevent group
                    Polarization, such as encouraging dissent, and having a 
                    dedicated "Devil's Advocate". </p>
                    <p> I also have to update my resume and apply for a few more
                    internships, I'm not having much luck with that. I'm sure
                    there's a company for me out there somewhere. </p>
